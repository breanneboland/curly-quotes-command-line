# Curly Quotes Removal, in Many Flavors

All run from the command line - just in different ways.

### command-line-quote-fixer

The original flavor. Run with ```python3 command-line-quote-fixer.py```.

### refactor-with-modules dir

Made to experiment with modules and imports. Run with ```python3 fixer.py```. It'll tell you what else you need to know.

### command-line-quote-fixer-argparse

Same functionality, now with argparse. Run with ```python3 command-line-quote-fixer-argparse.py``` to see its full argparsimoniousness. Run with ```python3 command-line-quote-fixer-argparse.py [string]``` to see it do its thing.
